# 15-PuzzleSolver

Solves a given 15-puzzle (more commonly known as a slide puzzle) and outputs a step-by-step solution.

To run the program, either run the .exe file directly or compile and execute the .cpp file.
To view the solution, open whatever directory your .exe file is in and open "solution.txt" after running the program at least once.

Note that the current build does not take user input (hope to fix this soon!). 
The input puzzle configuration is found on line 526 of the cpp file.
If you wish to change the input, make sure to include all numbers 1-16 exactly once or the program may break.
